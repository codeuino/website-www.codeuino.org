              Codeuino is an Open Source organization that helps to bring
              amazing people together to create, develop, design and make things
              with Open Technologies and share work for the benefit of all.Our
              project is an important part of Free Software Ecosystem.We work
              with other free projects to create high - quality solutions that
              span the entire software stack.While the many Codeuino
              contributors develop code, smash bugs, write documentation, and
              help users, the Foundation acts as a guiding hand in the process
              and provides resources and infrastructure.It steers releases,
              determines what software is officially part of the project, and
              acts as an official face of the Codeuino Project to the outside
              world, through it delegates most of its authority to specialized
              teams.Therefore, this guide would help you to become an integral

            <p className="text" style={{ textAlign: "left" }}>
              To get started, the first step is to meet the community. We use
              Slack to communicate, and there the helpful community will guide
              you. Slack is an instant messaging service used by developers and
              users of Github. Slack uses chat rooms, where developers can join
              in and can talk about a particular topic. Codeuino has two types
              of chat rooms (channels) –{" "}
              <strong>Meeting channel and General channel.</strong>
              <br />
              <br />
              <strong>Meeting chat room</strong> is related to a specific
              details and <strong>General chat room</strong> is related to
              general discussion topics like conferences, workshops and it is
              here where we welcome Newcomers and guide them. This is the main
              chat room of Codeuino. Everything related to conferences and off
              topics are discussed here.
            </p>
            <p className="text" style={{ textAlign: "left" }}>
              The list of all available chat rooms are available here - channel
              list. But before joining the community, here are few things that
              you should keep in mind.

                  <b>2.</b>It will be appreciated if your Github username and

                  <b>3.</b>Do not mention users unrelated to a particular
                  issue/question. This also means you should not mention the
                  person that was last online. For example, mentioning someone
                  on a Github issue will subscribe them to that issue, even if
                  they don’t want to be a part of the discussion. However,
                  mentioning someone is okay if they really need to see your
                  message.

              <strong>Cloning our GitHub repository:-</strong> The git clone
              command is used to copy an existing Git repository from a server
              to the local machine. To clone our git repository follow these
              steps in your terminals:-
              <br />

                  <b>3.</b>Now pick an issue which isn’t assigned and which you
                  would like to fix. Leave a comment that you would like to work
                  on that particular issue. This way we don’t have multiple
                  people working on the same issue at the same time. After this,
                  you can start working on it.

                  <strong>Caution:-</strong> You should never work on an issue
                  without being assigned. Also take up the issue, only when you
                  know what the problem is and how to solve it.

            <p className="text-uppercase" style={{ textAlign: "left" }}>
              Step 4. Forking and Testing the Modifications
            </p>
            <p className="text" style={{ textAlign: "left" }}>
              You should first fork the repository by visiting the official
              repository of Codeuino and clicking on the button Fork. This step
              is needed only once.
              <br />
              <br />
              <strong>Important !!</strong> It is important that you DO NOT make
              your changes on the master branch of your forked repository as you
              cannot have two pull requests using the same branch name.
              Therefore, if your fork’s master has been used in a pull request
              and you decide to work on a different issue you will have to
              branch eventually. Differently every new commit that you make on
              your master branch will get attached to the initial pull request
              and that will result in altering the purpose of that request.
              <br />
              <br />
              You can create a branch per set of changes. To do that run:
              <strong>$ git checkout -b branchname</strong> where your branch
              name can be anything other than master. The scope is your forked
              repository. The branch name will be shown on pull request.Before
              pushing the pull request, you must test your changes with some
              concrete examples.
            </p>
            <p className="text-uppercase" style={{ textAlign: "left" }}>
              Step 5. Sending a Pull Request
            </p>
            <p className="text" style={{ textAlign: "left" }}>
              Now that your commit has been sent to your fork, it is time to
              create a Pull Request. You can do this by accessing your fork on
              GitHub and clicking New Pull Request. <br />
              <br />
              <strong>Note:-</strong> Comments are always welcomed, as the
              readability of the code becomes easy for the other developers.{" "}
              <br />
              <br />
              <strong>Creating a Pull Request:-</strong> If you've forked a
              repository and made changes to the fork, you can ask that the
              upstream repository accept your changes by creating a pull
              request.
              <br />
              <br />
              <strong>Note:</strong> To open a pull request in a public
              repository, you must have write access to the head or the source
              branch or, for organization-owned repositories, you must be a
              member of the organization that owns the repository to open a pull
              request. <br />
